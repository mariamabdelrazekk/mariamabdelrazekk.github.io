Project Name: Back from Class

Project Description: Since I redid my video, my project is a website showing my interests and work as a person, my recent work, the 30MFF film and reactions of some of my friends to the video. My concept for the video was to show the different phases of me going back to my dorm after classes, then eventually going to sleep. Having noticed that me and my roommates look so different throughout the day, I tracked how I have looked over the course of three days and I created a video showing me rushing back to my dorm after a night out, gym, a study session or class. 

Process: I put my recent work as a carousel so that people can navigate the content in a more fun way than scrolling. The three dots at the bottom indicate that there are three short films to view. I tried to make the reactions of my friends as a zoom-in experience. The video is the first thing you see when you open the website, therefore, it forces the use to kind of watch it. I created a drop-down list with which you can navigate through the website, you can go to the information page to learn more about me and my journey, my recent work and a link back to the home page. 

Reflection/evaluation:

I faced a lot of problems while developing the website that i tried to work on. First of all with the drop down list, when you refresh the page, you have to click on the list for it to be closes, it does not look the best. Second problem was the columns I made, no matter how many times I tried to make them stretch though the whole height of the page by using height=100% or height=”100vh”, it wouldn’t work. I also wanted to have the arrows that help you navigate through the carousel are not really well-aligned, I tried changing their position multiple times but, it would not work. For the reactions, I tried adding text, however, It could not align next to the pictures and the pictures were sort of aligned to the left event though I wanted them to be aligned in the center. All in all, I faced multiple difficulties achieving my goals for this website, however, I think that overall it is functioning and communicates the content that I want it to.
